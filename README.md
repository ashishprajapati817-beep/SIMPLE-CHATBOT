# ðŸ¤– Simple OpenAI Chatbot (Day-14 Project)

This is a **beginner-friendly chatbot project** built as part of my AI learning roadmap (Day-14 milestone).  

It is designed using only the concepts Iâ€™ve learned till Day-13:
- Python basics (variables, loops, conditions)
- Dictionaries & lists
- JSON-like request/response
- Reading API keys from environment variables
- Making an API call to OpenAI

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Features (Day-14 Scope)
- Console-based chatbot (type and get replies)
- Reads API key securely from environment (no hardcoding)
- Friendly personality defined via system role
- Continuous chat until the user types **bye/exit/quit**
- Lightweight and minimal â€” just enough to work!

---

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements (beyond Day-14)
- Add conversation memory (remember past turns)
- Add commands (`/help`, `/reset`)
- Error handling (network/API failures)
- Deployment to web/Telegram/WhatsApp
